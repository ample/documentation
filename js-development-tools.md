# Task Runners

### Grunt

### Gulp

## Additional Tools

### Browserify
Solution to having both NPM and Bower for management. Can utilize CommonJS to pack `node_modules` files for use cleanly on the front-end

### Webpack
Similar to Browserify but is a configuration based system that can run without a task runner
